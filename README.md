Live Demo: [https://stoic-chatbot.onrender.com/](https://stoic-chatbot-zumw.onrender.com)


An immersive web application where users can seek wisdom and guidance by engaging in conversations with AI-powered personas of the great Stoic philosophers: Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, and Epictetus, or a collective Stoic Sage.

About The Project

This project was born from a desire to make the profound wisdom of Stoicism more accessible and interactive. Instead of just reading their words, this application allows you to "speak" with the philosophers themselves. The AI's responses are grounded in the actual writings and philosophies of each thinker, providing authentic, in-character counsel on life, ethics, and personal challenges.

The application features a beautiful, atmospheric homepage with a parchment theme that leads to dedicated, themed chat rooms for each philosopher.
